          <p>I’ve often heard if you want to really know somebody, ask the person
            closest to them. So, here is an
            “About Me” section explained by my wife.

            My name is Brian Monda. I live in Central Missouri with my wife and two boys. On any random day,
            you
            will find me outside either chasing my 3 year old (who is likely half-way dressed) or playing
            basketball
            with my oldest. I am an outgoing introvert. I love to be around my family and friends, but to
            recharge
            my batteries, I prefer to be at home, in my chair, listening to my audio book. For all my
            personality
            test lovers: I am an Enneagram 9 (if you don’t know what this is, ask my wife) and an INTP on
            Myers
            Briggs.

            Professionally, I have worked in different settings. From account management for John Deere
            equipment to
            home loans, but my passion has always been what you will find here: Figuring out the inner
            dialogue to
            make what you see on this screen or simply put, programming.

            So in summary, I am a dad, husband, an introverted techy that is just chasing his dream to have
            a career
            that I am passionate about. My portfolio shows my past projects that I will be continuously
            building on.
